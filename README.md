Capture-recapture models with individual heterogeneity
==================================================

We provide here the code to illustrate CR models with individual heterogeneity, namely CR multistate, random-effect and 
finite-mixture models. 

* Dynamic occupancy models
* Dynamic occupancy models with false positives
* Static/single-season models as particular cases of dynamic models (soon to come)
* Models with heterogeneity - finite mixture (soon to come)
* Multistate models (soon to come)
* Multispecies models (soon to come)
* Covariates (soon to come)

The prefix `fit` is for fitting a model, `sim` is for simulating data from a model and `dev` is for the function that gives (half) the deviance (for internal use, but you're free to look into it). The suffix `colext` is for dynamic models (which I stole from `unmarked`), `colextfp` for dynamic models with false positives.
